Create FlowFields and FlowFilters


Example
In the following example, MyTable sets the Global Dimension 1 Filter and Global Dimension 2 Filter fields whose values are based only 
on the dimension values included in the filter. Also, some of the following fields formulate the currency filter to one single currency 
because you do not store the filter value on the entries, hence you define the Currency Filter as a FlowFilter type. 
Total Amount, Amount upper bound, Amount lower bound, First Entry, and Customer Balance are classified as a FlowField type and here you specify the calculations. 
These fields display the results immediately based on the filters that you apply in the user interface.
